### [The flow experience as the phenomenological aspect of a cognitive theory of attention](/images/portfolio/rjw_phil3422_2016-0526.pdf)

Term paper for [PHIL 3422: _Philosophical issues in Cognitive Science_](http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/courses/ShowCourse.do?redirect=/acad/course_info.jsp&dsc=PHIL.&crs_num=3422&div=U)

> In this essay we present an argument that the subjective experience of flow is the phenomenological
aspect of a cognitive process that maximizes Shannon entropy of information transmission. This process
provides a substantial enough channel for pertinent information to facilitate the operant task at hand,
while minimizing the overall channel size of all information. As the information requirements of a task
change dynamically, so does the channel size that this process provides. In folk psychology terms this
would be known as 'attention'.
